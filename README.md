# procon
procon is an extension to the popular pm4py process mining library with the goal to enable conformance checking on BPMN models.
Assume you have an advanced BPMN 2.0 model, maybe with cancellation features, and you have gathered event data, e.g. from your
ERP or CRM system. You are very likely interested to see how well the real worl process behavior matches the desired process model.
procon gives you the opportunity to do that with only a few lines of Python code!

## Installation
procon can be installed on Python 3.7.x / 3.8.x / 3.9.x by doing:
```bash
pip install -U procon
```
